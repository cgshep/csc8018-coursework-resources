 Hi everyone, it's Peter here. So in this short video, I'm just going to run through the sample solution to the coursework with you to show you what the accessibility features should look like when you're looking at an image.

00:00:15.620 --> 00:00:26.160
 So, a little like I've talked through with you in lectures, it's really important to make sure that your website is accessible for people who maybe use a screen reader.

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:44.420
 So, that's what I'm going to do today. I've got an Apple Mac computer here and I'm going to use the VoiceOver screen reader just to show you an example of how the pictures are supposed to look to a blind or visually impaired person who is using the screen reader on the computer.

00:00:44.920 --> 00:00:55.860
 So, I'm going to turn VoiceOver on on the computer. Now, before we begin, you'll notice that we are logged into Canvas. You will need to be logged into Canvas for the images to load correctly.

00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:55.960
 Okay.

00:00:56.160 --> 00:01:10.039
 If you're pulling them in properly to the website. So, without further ado, I'm just going to take you through the first part of the website so you can see how it's structured and how the accessibility modifications should work to an image.


00:01:23.860 --> 00:01:26.120
 So, I'm just going to move.

00:01:26.160 --> 00:01:29.539
 Through the page elements until I reach the first image.


00:01:55.860 --> 00:02:03.200
 So you can see here examples of how the tags are spaced out and why it's really

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:10.419
 important to ensure you nest your tags properly and your heading levels. 


00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:22.760
 So, now we have our first figure and we

00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:29.380
 approach the first image. So with appropriate alt text on, the screen reader will read as follows.


00:02:40.959 --> 00:02:46.820
 And this is just an example of what text could say. Obviously it is up to you to decide suitable

00:02:46.820 --> 00:02:52.579
 alt text, but we do expect that the alt text should be descriptive so that somebody who

00:02:52.580 --> 00:02:58.360
 can't see the image understands what's going on in the image. So if we move through into the next

00:02:58.360 --> 00:03:03.200
 descriptor and through the first text, you'll be able to see how the screen reader performs as we

00:03:03.200 --> 00:03:08.020
 move through.


00:03:48.820 --> 00:03:52.540
 And so you see how the heading level twos are also,

00:03:52.580 --> 00:03:58.340
 displayed. So I'm not going to go any further through the solution than this because as I say,

00:03:58.340 --> 00:04:04.580
 it's up to you to decide how to ensure your website is fully accessible. But I hope this helps show you

00:04:04.580 --> 00:04:11.580
 a little bit of what an accessible website for this coursework solution looks like. Thank you.
