00:00:00.720 --> 00:00:07.920
 Hi everyone, it's Peter here. So in this video I just want to run through the solution to the

00:00:07.920 --> 00:00:12.080
 coursework just to give you a feel for how it should look when you build your solution,

00:00:12.880 --> 00:00:19.520
 to give you something that looks a little more interactive, shall we say, than the images that

00:00:19.520 --> 00:00:28.800
 you have to copy from. So here I'm looking at the Chessboxing HTML webpage. So this is when you run

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:35.920
 your finished solution and you do so without running any of the CSS, this is what it should

00:00:35.920 --> 00:00:42.320
 look like. Now the first thing I want to draw your attention to is we have our Chessboxing title at

00:00:42.320 --> 00:00:50.320
 the top. Beneath that we have some links that take you to different sections of the of the page and

00:00:50.320 --> 00:00:57.120
 beneath this we have a problem with our image. So this, if you've seen the photo, is where you

00:00:57.120 --> 00:00:58.780
 should have the image. So if you've seen the image, you should have the image. So if you've seen the

00:00:58.780 --> 00:00:58.800
 image, you should have the image. So if you've seen the image, you should have the image. So if you've

00:00:58.800 --> 00:00:58.820
 seen the image, you should have the image. So if you've seen the image, you should have the image.

00:00:58.820 --> 00:01:06.100
 Chessboxing image. However, we have an issue with that and that is because the images are stored on

00:01:06.100 --> 00:01:13.899
 canvas. So please do bear this in mind when you are loading your images. Do remember to log into

00:01:13.899 --> 00:01:19.580
 canvas so that they will load. So what I'm going to do now is I'm going to log into canvas and then

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:27.340
 refresh this page. All right, so I'm now logged into canvas. So now I'm just going to refresh my

00:01:27.340 --> 00:01:28.780
 page.

00:01:28.780 --> 00:01:35.540
 And you'll see that the image has now loaded. So now we have the first image has loaded correctly.

00:01:35.540 --> 00:01:41.780
 And this should be the case with all of the images that have been uploaded to canvas for you. So if

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:46.760
 you do get that error, just make sure that you are logged into canvas. And remember that if you are

00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:54.360
 not on campus, you may need to authenticate with canvas to allow it to let you load them up. So if

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:58.760
 they're not showing up, just make sure that you have done that step. So moving down,

00:01:58.760 --> 00:02:07.760
 the page, you'll see that everything here is the same as in photograph, chestboxing, HTML, .png.

00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:16.000
 Nothing has been added, removed, or reordered. Everything remains the same. And indeed, this is how your

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:24.840
 solution should look. So if I just scroll to the very bottom, and you'll see at the very bottom, we have

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:28.040
 some external links, one to Wikipedia.

00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:37.320
 And if I go back, there's a second link to the chestboxing nation. Both of those links should work and take us to those

00:02:37.320 --> 00:02:38.320
 websites.

00:02:38.320 --> 00:02:49.920
 If I resize my window, there is not any significant changes because the HTML just, it just scales itself. We have no

00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:57.260
 styles applied and there should be no styles applied when you're running it in this view. Looking now at the CSS

00:02:57.260 --> 00:02:58.760
 version of the website.

00:02:59.359 --> 00:03:04.140
 Again, you'll see I need to refresh the page since we've now logged into canvas.

00:03:04.140 --> 00:03:06.820
 And then our images will load in.

00:03:06.820 --> 00:03:14.980
 So you have your title at the top, along with the navigation bar, which has the correct colors

00:03:14.980 --> 00:03:18.480
 for links when you hover with the mouse.

00:03:18.480 --> 00:03:23.200
 These links will take you to different anchor points in the page.

00:03:23.200 --> 00:03:25.320
 Then we have our text paragraphs here.

00:03:25.320 --> 00:03:26.880
 A little ichor to these links, an enwrap fade action will just show up in the match for photos.

00:03:26.880 --> 00:03:28.320
 Again you'll see I need to refresh the page since we've now logged

00:03:28.320 --> 00:03:32.320
 along with some boxes that float off to the right hand side.

00:03:32.320 --> 00:03:36.320
 You'll notice that there is a maximum width of the white page here

00:03:36.320 --> 00:03:40.320
 with some grey border at the right and left hand edges.

00:03:40.320 --> 00:03:45.320
 If I extend the window, the size of the grey border gets bigger

00:03:45.320 --> 00:03:48.320
 but the white page stays the same size.

00:03:48.320 --> 00:03:56.320
 I can shrink the page to begin shrinking past the grey area

00:03:56.320 --> 00:04:00.320
 and then once I've done that, the white page will start scaling.

00:04:00.320 --> 00:04:04.320
 So you see here, this is the suppressed floating of elements

00:04:04.320 --> 00:04:07.320
 which is something we're looking for in your solution.

00:04:07.320 --> 00:04:12.320
 As I continue to shrink the page, the box moves into the centre

00:04:12.320 --> 00:04:16.320
 and as I move even further, we switch to the mobile view of the website

00:04:16.320 --> 00:04:23.320
 where we have again our links which should now extend to fill the full width of the screen

00:04:23.320 --> 00:04:26.320
 and we can scroll down this page

00:04:26.320 --> 00:04:31.320
 to be able to see any of the symbols that we want.

00:04:31.320 --> 00:04:34.320
 So again, we have our values here.

00:04:34.320 --> 00:04:39.320
 This table, we have hovering actions present on here

00:04:39.320 --> 00:04:47.320
 so if we hover over the table, they highlight with different colours

00:04:47.320 --> 00:04:53.320
 and we can continue to scroll down to the very bottom of this page.

00:04:53.320 --> 00:04:55.320
 Again, all the content is exactly the same.

00:04:55.320 --> 00:04:56.320
 It's just that we have a little bit of a difference between the two.

00:04:56.320 --> 00:04:59.320
 So we can do the same as in the HTML version

00:04:59.320 --> 00:05:04.320
 except now we have the chess symbols on the headings here.

00:05:04.320 --> 00:05:07.320
 And as I extend the box once more,

00:05:07.320 --> 00:05:14.320
 you'll notice that the table begins to extend slightly.

00:05:14.320 --> 00:05:17.320
 So when we have marks for suppressing floating

00:05:17.320 --> 00:05:21.320
 and the organisations box, when you see that in the mark scheme,

00:05:21.320 --> 00:05:25.320
 we are talking about making sure you collapse

00:05:25.320 --> 00:05:28.320
 and show this in a correct manner.

00:05:28.320 --> 00:05:32.320
 So just to show you quickly the links as I haven't done that yet,

00:05:32.320 --> 00:05:36.320
 if I click the history link, I get taken to the history heading.

00:05:36.320 --> 00:05:40.320
 If I click the rules link, I get taken to rules and so on.

00:05:40.320 --> 00:05:45.320
 And likewise from the HTML page, if I click history, I go to history.

00:05:45.320 --> 00:05:49.320
 If I click rules, I go to rules and so on.

00:05:49.320 --> 00:05:54.320
 So that just gives you a brief overview of what the finished solution should look like.

00:05:54.320 --> 00:06:01.320
 If you do have any questions, please do come along to a practical class

00:06:01.320 --> 00:06:04.320
 or get in touch on the Canvas community.

00:06:04.320 --> 00:06:05.320
 Thank you.
