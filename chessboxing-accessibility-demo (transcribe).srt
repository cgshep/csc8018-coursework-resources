 Hi everyone, it's Peter here. So in this short video, I'm just going to run through the sample solution to the coursework with you to show you what the accessibility features should look like when you're looking at an image.

2
00:00:15,620 --> 00:00:26,160
 So, a little like I've talked through with you in lectures, it's really important to make sure that your website is accessible for people who maybe use a screen reader.

3
00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:44,420
 So, that's what I'm going to do today. I've got an Apple Mac computer here and I'm going to use the VoiceOver screen reader just to show you an example of how the pictures are supposed to look to a blind or visually impaired person who is using the screen reader on the computer.

4
00:00:44,920 --> 00:00:55,860
 So, I'm going to turn VoiceOver on on the computer. Now, before we begin, you'll notice that we are logged into Canvas. You will need to be logged into Canvas for the images to load correctly.

5
00:00:55,860 --> 00:00:55,960
 Okay.

6
00:00:56,160 --> 00:01:10,039
 If you're pulling them in properly to the website. So, without further ado, I'm just going to take you through the first part of the website so you can see how it's structured and how the accessibility modifications should work to an image.

7
00:01:11,880 --> 00:01:23,860
 VoiceOver on Safari. Personal CSC 8018 Chess Boxing window. CSC 8018 Chess Boxing web content has keyboard focus. You are currently on a banner inside web content.

8
00:01:23,860 --> 00:01:26,120
 So, I'm just going to move.

9
00:01:26,160 --> 00:01:29,539
 Through the page elements until I reach the first image.

10
00:01:30,259 --> 00:01:32,840
 Edding level 1 Chess Boxing.

11
00:01:32,860 --> 00:01:33,440
 navigation.

12
00:01:34,119 --> 00:01:36,240
 You are currently in a list for items.

13
00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:38,140
 You are currently in a list.

14
00:01:40,160 --> 00:01:41,399
 history one a four

15
00:01:41,880 --> 00:01:43,759

16
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:44,500
 according.

17

18
00:01:45,220 --> 00:01:46,039

19
00:01:46,360 --> 00:01:48,900
 bank members than Smashen for school.

20
00:01:49,600 --> 00:01:51,840
 You are currently on a link and have less.

21
00:01:52,520 --> 00:01:54,400
 You are and off navigation.

22
00:01:54,960 --> 00:01:55,860
 You are currently on.

23
00:01:55,860 --> 00:02:03,200
 navigation. So you can see here examples of how the tags are spaced out and why it's really

24
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:10,419
 important to ensure you nest your tags properly and your heading levels. End of banner. You are

25
00:02:10,419 --> 00:02:16,260
 currently on a main. Fighting is done in the ring and wars are waged on the board. We're a chess

26
00:02:16,260 --> 00:02:22,760
 boxing organization. Figure. You are currently in a figure. So now we have our first figure and we

27
00:02:22,760 --> 00:02:29,380
 approach the first image. So with appropriate alt text on, the screen reader will read as follows.

28
00:02:29,959 --> 00:02:35,140
 A photo of two men sitting at a table with a chess board on top. Image. You are currently on an image.

29
00:02:35,420 --> 00:02:40,140
 To begin interacting with the contents of this image, press control option shift down arrow.

30
00:02:40,959 --> 00:02:46,820
 And this is just an example of what text could say. Obviously it is up to you to decide suitable

31
00:02:46,820 --> 00:02:52,579
 alt text, but we do expect that the alt text should be descriptive so that somebody who

32
00:02:52,580 --> 00:02:58,360
 can't see the image understands what's going on in the image. So if we move through into the next

33
00:02:58,360 --> 00:03:03,200
 descriptor and through the first text, you'll be able to see how the screen reader performs as we

34
00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:08,020
 move through. Fighting is done in the ring and wars are waged on the board. We're a chess boxing

35
00:03:08,020 --> 00:03:14,100
 organization. You are currently on a figure. Chess boxing is a hybrid that combines two

36
00:03:14,100 --> 00:03:18,460
 traditional pastimes, chess and boxing. The competitors compete in alternating rounds of

37
00:03:18,460 --> 00:03:22,560
 chess and boxing. You are currently on a selectable text. The basic text is a text that is not a text.

38
00:03:22,580 --> 00:03:26,400
 The basic idea in chess boxing is to combine the number one thinking sport with the number one

39
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:30,720
 fighting sport into a hybrid that demands the most of its competitors, both mentally and physically.

40
00:03:31,180 --> 00:03:36,120
 One of the goals of this new sport is the old idea of a healthy mind and a healthy body. During a

41
00:03:36,120 --> 00:03:41,240
 chess boxing fight, the control of aggression plays a big role. You are currently on a selectable text.

42
00:03:41,820 --> 00:03:47,680
 Heading level two, two items. White chess queen, history. You are currently on a heading level two.

43
00:03:48,820 --> 00:03:52,540
 And so you see how the heading level twos are also,

44
00:03:52,580 --> 00:03:58,340
 displayed. So I'm not going to go any further through the solution than this because as I say,

45
00:03:58,340 --> 00:04:04,580
 it's up to you to decide how to ensure your website is fully accessible. But I hope this helps show you

46
00:04:04,580 --> 00:04:11,580
 a little bit of what an accessible website for this coursework solution looks like. Thank you.
